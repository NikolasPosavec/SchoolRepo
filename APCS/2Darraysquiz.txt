(1) there is a method called getTotal that totals all the values in a
2D array of integers, use a nested for loop to find the largest of
all elements in the integer array matrix[][].
public int findLargest()
{
}

(2) change the red and green pixels to be blue using nested for-each loops, 
do what zeroblue does basically

(3) write appropriate header for SimplePicture class
the flow chart thingy - 
(a) simplepicture implements digital picture
(b) picture extends simplepicture
(c) a simple picture has 1* pixels, 1 single picture belogns to simple picture
(d) do same as c for pixles & color

(4) why cant use nested for-each loops for mirror vertical
(5) how would change code from row major to column major
(6) choose any mirroring method from picture lab and implement it any way youd like. 
explain what its mirroring
