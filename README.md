#School Repository
##This is my repo for school assignments from my Honors Programming class I took last year along with my AP Computer Science work from this year.
###We work in java and focus mainly on making programs that solve classic AP style problems. However, we are also doing a portfolio project in which we will showcase programming skills not covered by the AP subset
